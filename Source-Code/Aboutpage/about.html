        <h2>About Kuwait</h2>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>Kuwait is a small country in the northeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, bordered by Iraq to the
                north
                and west, Saudi Arabia to the south, and the Persian Gulf to the east. Its capital city is Kuwait City,
                which is also the country's largest city. Kuwait has a total land area of approximately 17,818 square
                kilometers, making it one of the smallest countries in the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Kuwait has a rich history that dates back to ancient times. It was an important trade center due to its
                strategic location along the Persian Gulf. In the 18th century, Kuwait was established as an independent
                sheikhdom under the Al-Sabah family, who still rule the country today. Kuwait gained independence from
                the
                United Kingdom on June 19, 1961.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>Economy</h3>
            <p>Kuwait has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, mainly due to its significant oil
                reserves.
                The discovery of oil in the 1930s transformed Kuwait into one of the wealthiest countries in the Middle
                East. The oil industry remains the backbone of the economy, accounting for a substantial portion of
                government revenue and export earnings. Kuwait has tried diversifying its economy in recent years by
                investing in various sectors such as finance, trade, and tourism.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Kuwait's culture is deeply rooted in Islamic traditions, strongly emphasizing family, hospitality, and
                respect for elders. Arabic is the official language, and Islam is the state religion, with most Kuwaitis
                being Sunni Muslims. The country celebrates various cultural events and festivals, such as National Day
                on
                February 25th and Liberation Day on February 26th. Traditional music, dance, and cuisine play a vital
                role
                in Kuwaiti culture, with dishes like machboos (a spiced rice dish with meat) being popular.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>Politics</h3>
            <p>Kuwait is a constitutional emirate with a semi-democratic political system. The Emir of Kuwait is the
                head of
                state and holds significant executive powers, while the National Assembly (Majlis Al-Umma) is the
                legislative body. The National Assembly consists of 50 elected members who serve four-year terms. Kuwait
                has
                a relatively open political environment compared to some of its neighbors, with active participation
                from
                various political groups and a degree of press freedom.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>Society</h3>
            <p>Kuwait has a diverse and cosmopolitan society with a significant expatriate population. Foreign workers
                comprise a large workforce, primarily from South Asia, the Middle East, and Western countries. The
                government provides extensive social services, including free healthcare, education, and subsidized
                housing
                for Kuwaiti citizens. The standard of living is high, with modern infrastructure, shopping malls, and
                entertainment facilities throughout the country.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-block">
            <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p>Kuwait's climate is characterized by scorching summers and mild winters. The country experiences very
                little
                rainfall, and much of the landscape is dominated by desert terrain. Despite its arid environment, Kuwait
                has
                tried to address environmental issues such as water scarcity and pollution. Initiatives include water
                desalination projects and investment in renewable energy sources.</p>
